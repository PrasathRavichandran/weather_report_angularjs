This project was built on the top of AngularJS, WeatherAPI and Bootstrap to see how this MV* framework is interacts with other layers of the application. This project is merely my attempt to put something together based on the ideas put accross in AngularJS course videos and documentation.

## Wireframe
I used [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/xd.html) to design this application wireframe.

## Concepts
In this project I have used [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) and I also integrate [weathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) in particular I utilize [forecast api](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) which is helpful for getting weather reports of particular cities on the searched basis. 
## Platforms
This application is built under [AngularJS(1.7.9)](https://angularjs.org/), [Bootstrap(4.4.1)](https://getbootstrap.com/) and I used [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an IDE.
## Development Server
Run `npm i live-server -g` to install [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) package globally in your computer. Navigate to your project folder and run `live-server`. The app will automatically open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in the browser and it reload if you change any of the source files.
